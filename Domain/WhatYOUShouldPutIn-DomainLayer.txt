What you should put inside your Domain Layer :

1. Entities/Models:

Entities are like the main characters in your application. 
They represent real-world objects with a distinct identity. 
For example, in an e-commerce application, you might have entities like Product, Order, and User. 
Each entity has only properties. Not methods, the methods are going to be implemented inside the Dto's (Data Transfer Objects) inside of the Application Layer along with the validation methods.
