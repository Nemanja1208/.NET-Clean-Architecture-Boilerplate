#DOMAIN LAYER

The Domain Layer in Clean Architecture represents the core of your application. 

It contains the business logic and rules that are unique to your application's domain. 

Let's break down the Domain Layer in simpler terms and provide more detail on what it's all about and how it's used:

1. Business Logic:

The Domain Layer is where you define the rules and operations that are essential to your application's core functionality. 
These rules are often related to your business domain, such as e-commerce, healthcare, finance, or any other area your application serves.

2. Entities/Models:

Entities are like the main characters in your application. 
They represent real-world objects with a distinct identity. 
For example, in an e-commerce application, you might have entities like Product, Order, and User. 
Each entity has properties and methods that encapsulate its behavior.

3. Value Objects:

Value objects are objects without a distinct identity but are essential to your domain. 
These can represent concepts like money, addresses, dates, or quantities. 
For instance, a Price value object might include properties for the amount and currency.

4. Domain Services:

Domain services are classes that provide specific operations or services related to your domain. 
They don't have identity like entities. 
For example, you might have a DiscountCalculator domain service that calculates discounts based on certain rules.

5. Rules and Validations:

The Domain Layer enforces rules and constraints. 
For instance, it ensures that a product's price cannot be negative, or that an order cannot be placed without valid payment information. 
These rules are checked and enforced within the Domain Layer.

6. Independence:

The Domain Layer should be entirely independent of the outside world, including the database or the user interface. 
It doesn't depend on Entity Framework, MySQL, or any specific technology. 
This isolation makes it easier to test and maintain the core logic of your application.

7. How It's Used:

The Domain Layer is used by the Application Layer. 
Application services in the Application Layer orchestrate operations in the Domain Layer. 
For example, when a user places an order, the application service would call methods on the Order entity in the Domain Layer to handle the order creation and validation.

8. Testing (Should be written in Tests layer of Clean Architecture !):
Writing tests for the Domain Layer is crucial. 
You can write unit tests to ensure that the business logic and rules in this layer work correctly. 
These tests help maintain the quality and reliability of your application.

In summary, the Domain Layer is where you define and implement the core rules, entities, and value objects specific to your application's domain. 
It encapsulates the unique behaviour and logic that sets your application apart. 
It's decoupled from the technical details of data storage or presentation and is focused on maintaining the integrity and consistency of your application's core functionality.
